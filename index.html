    <h2> WHY LEARN ABOUT IT? </h2>
      <h3>If you have ever been on a vehicle that runs on gasoline/diesel or ever used elecrticity,
                        you need to know this.</h3>
      <p align="center"><font size="3" ><mark><b>62.7% of total electricity comes from natural gas, coal and crude oil.
                                            According to the U.S. EIA the global supply of crude oil, other liquid hydrocarbons,
                                            and biofuels is expected to be adequate to meet the world's demand for liquid fuels through 2050.
                                            It is estimated that there are 2462 trillion cubic feet of natural gas left.Enough to last the US for 90 years.
                                            <br>What happens after 2050?<b></mark></p>
      <p class="intro1">HydroCarbons trapped in soil deep under the ocean become crude oil and
      natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas when refined become petroleum products such a gasoline,diesel,fuel. </p>
      <p class="intro2"><font size="3">SO? In 2017, the United States consumed a total of 7.26 billion barrels of petroleum products,
      an average of about 19.88 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p class="intro2"><font size="3">Also! On use, they release unbunrned HydroCarbons aka pollutants that cause global warming.</p>

      <p class="intro3"><font size="3"><b>So humankind relies on something limited to power daily lives while causing harm to daily life?
      Might as well learn more about these hydrocarbons to save yourself and others?</p>
      <h3> Things to think about before you find out the answers :</b> </h3>
      <p><font size="3"> 1. How is crude oil and natural gas formed, spotted and extracted?</p>
      <p> 2. How fast does oil form? Why are we running out by 2050?</p>
      <p> 3. What carbon footprint does your oil usage has on the environmnet? How many pounds of CO2 are you releasing? </p>
    <h2> Part 1. How does the hydrocarbon get trapped in the Soil and what happens thereon? </h2>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Step 1: Phytoplantons die and hit the ocean floor to decompose.</h3>
      <p>Oil comes from the remains of tiny plants and animals (plankton) that died in ancient seas between 10 million
        and 600 million years ago.After the organisms died, they sank into the sand and mud at the bottom of the sea.
        Usually they are eaten by other aquatic organisms and never hit the ocean floor.</p>
      <div class="sp"></div>
      <h3>Step 2: Layers of mud and soil accumulate decomposing and trapping the dead Phytoplantons</h3>
      <p> Over the years, the organisms decayed in the sedimentary layers. In these layers, there is little to no oxygen present.
          So microorganisms broke the remains into carbon-rich compounds that form organic layers.
          The organic material mixes with the sediments, forming fine-grained shale, or source rock.
          As more sedimentary layers are  deposited, they exert intense pressure and heat on the source rock.
          The heat and pressure distills the organic material into crude oil and natural gas.
      </p>
      <div class="s"></div>
      <br/>
      <h3>Step 3: Oil and natural gas rise up to reservoir rock.</h3>
      <p> The oil flows from the source rock and accumulats in thicker, more porous limestone or sandstone, called reservoir rock.
        Movements in the Earth traps the oil and natural gas in the reservoir rocks between layers of impermeable rock, or
        cap rock, such as granite or marble.These movements of the Earth include:
        Folding, Faulting, Pinching out  </p>
      <br/>
      <div class="s"></div>
      <br>
      <h3>Step 4: Oil is found and extracted</h3>
      <p> Whether employed directly by an oil company or under contract from a private firm, geologists are the ones responsible for
          finding oil. Geologists use sensitive gravity meters to measure tiny changes in the Earth's gravitational field that could
          indicate flowing oil, as well as sensitive magnetometers to measure tiny changes in the Earth's magnetic field caused by flowing
          oil. They also use seismology, creating shock waves that pass through hidden rock layers and interpreting the waves that are reflected back
          to the surface. Once located, oil companies send out rigs to drill holes into the ocean floor to extract oil. </p>
      <br><br><br>
      <h3> Step 5: What is in the water now?</h3>
      <p> During drilling and post drilling, chemicals and toxic substances are released.In addition, if sesimec waves are used to locate
        oil, they can diorient sea animals like whales stranding them on beach.And, oil spills can damage marine life and environment to a large extent.
        It has been stated that 195 million gallons of gas are lost in our oceans from oil extraction, transportation and consumption. It would also raise
        the risk of damaging the pristine waters of the Arctic and pose a threat to the animals which are already at risk due to global warming</p>
